#### Reasoning - The case of inequality

<br>

The percentage of students who play all 3 games is more than 10% when there is double counting in the covering. For example, when there is 1 student who does not play badminton, and does not play basketball.

Double counting does not arise when **all** students play at least 2 of these games. In this case, the percentage of students who play all 3 games is exactly 10%.
