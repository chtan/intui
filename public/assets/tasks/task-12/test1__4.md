<br>

Thus, the percentage of students who play all 3 of these games is at least 10%.

It is precisely 10% when there is not a single student who does not play 2 or more of these 3 games. 

In other words, there is not a single student who plays exactly 1 of these games or none at all. 

This means that every student plays at least 2 of these games.
